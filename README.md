## ‚úçÔ∏è Adding Blog Posts

Create a new MDX file in `blog/content/` with format `your-post-title.mdx`:

````mdx
---
title: "Your Blog Post Title"
description: "A brief description of your post"
date: "2024-12-01"
tags: ["React", "Next.js", "Tutorial"]
featured: true
readTime: "10 min read"
author: "Your Name"
---

Your blog post content here...

## Markdown Support

You can use all standard Markdown features plus MDX components.

```tsx
// Code syntax highlighting works great!
export default function Component() {
  return <div>Hello World!</div>;
}
```
````

In the future, we will have our own CMS built with Directus to accommodate complex structures.

## üé® Customization

### Adding New Tags/Categories

Simply add them to your blog post frontmatter. The system automatically generates tag pages.

### Featured Posts

Set `featured: true` in your blog post frontmatter to highlight it on the homepage (you can create a dedicated feature section in the home page).

### Styling

The project uses Tailwind CSS with a custom design system. Modify styles in:

- `app/globals.css` - Global styles
- Individual component files - Component-specific styles

### For Authors

Add your author details to the `lib/authors.ts` file.

```tsx
// lib/authors.ts
export const authors: Record<string, Author> = {
  dillion: {
    name: "Dillion Verma",
    position: "Software Engineer",
    avatar: "/authors/dillion.png",
  },
  arghya: {
    name: "Arghya Das",
    position: "Design System Engineer",
    avatar: "/authors/arghya.png",
  },
  // Add your author details here
  yourname: {
    name: "Your Full Name",
    position: "Your Position/Title",
    avatar: "/authors/your-avatar.png",
  },
} as const;
```

Then reference your author in blog posts using the key (e.g., `author: "yourname"`).
